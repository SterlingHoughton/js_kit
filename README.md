# Javascript starter kit V1.0

## EDITOR AND EDITORCONFIG RULES
Everyone on team uses same critical editor settings (space vs tabs, line endings etc.)
Strong support for javascript features, including:
* Autocompletion
* Parse ES6 imports
* Report unused imports
* Automated refactoring
* Framework Intelligence
* Built-in terminal

## EDITORCONFIG FILE
Create .editorconfig file in the root of the project. You can specify settings for code here. Some editors have the functionality built in to read file, some need a plugin (check editorconfig.org for details).

## PACKAGE SECURITY
Options for security check:
#### retire.js
* I've not used this yet, more to come.

#### nodesecuirty.io
* To install: 
`npm install nsp`
`nsp check` 
Check/scans pacakges, will get results in consule if working. Can be installed globally.

__Best times to run security checks on packages:__
* Manually - Easy to forget.
* npm install - Issues may arise from packages at a later date (after it was installed).
* production build - Expensive to change.
* pull request - Expensive to change.
* npm start - Slows start slightly.

## WEBSERVERS
#### http-server
* (not for use in production, only for development)

#### live-server
* (not for use in produciton, only for development)

#### express / koa / hapi
* Robust, production ready (especially express/hapi)

#### budo
* (also a bundler)

#### webpack
* (also a bundler, comprehensive)

#### Browsersync
* (dedicated IP for sharing work on LAN, all interactions remain in sync, integrates with webpack, express)

## SHARING WORK-IN-PROGRESS
#### localtunnel
* Very easy to get started, low friction level of learning and usage. Easiest, ultra-versatile

#### ngrok
* Some additional features over localtunnel, takes more time to configure. Easy setup, secure

#### surge
* Assumes your app is just static HTML, JS, and CSS files. Only supports static files. No firewall hole, hosting persists

#### now
* Easy way to deploy apps to the cloud, supports nodejs projects. No firewall hole, hosting persists

## AUTOMATION
We always want to automate our enviornment and builds whenever possible

#### Grunt
* First JS Task runner
* File oriented
* Large plugin ecosystem
* Configuration over code

#### Gulp
* In-memory streams (Gulp calls these pipes).
* Fast
* Code over configuration
* Large plugin ecosystem

#### npm Scripts
* Declared in package.json
* Leverage your OS' command line
* Directly use npm packages
* Call seperate Node scripts
* Convention-based pre/post hooks
* World's largest package manager
* Use tools directly
* No need for seperate plugins
* Simpler debugging
* Better docs
* Easy to learn, simple

## TRANSPILERS
Build Script JS Style comparisons:


|              __ES5__              |                   __Transpiled__                  |
|:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| No waiting for transpile = faster | Enjoy the latest JS features                      |
| No transpiler dependency          | Consistent coding style                           |
|                                   | Use the same linting rules everywhere             |
|                                   | Can eventually remove transpiler (as JS improves) |

Popular transpilers (won't cover them all here):

#### Babel
* Modern, standards-based JS, today (standardized JS)
* Enjoy all the new features of JS
* Transpiles the latest version of JS down to ES5
* Leverage full JS ecosystem
* Use experimental JS features earlier
* No type defs, annotations required
* ES6 imports are statically analyzable (editor can deterministically index entire code base and provide reliable intellisense support)
* Test, Lint, Babel, Great libs, IDE = safety

Two configuration styles:
 
`.babelrc` 
* Dedicated babel configuration file placed in project route
* Easier to read since it's isolated 

`package.json`
* One less file to your project

__PRESETS__ (transpile for your environment):

* `babel-preset-es2015-node` - Version Detection
* `babel-preset-latest-minimal` - Feature Detection 
 
#### TypeScript
* Superset of JS
* Type annotations (additional type safety)
* Enhanced autocompletion / readability
* Clearer intent
* some tools can't use TypeScript

#### Elm
* Compiles down to JS
* Clean Syntax
* Immutable data structures
* Friendly errors
* All errors are compile-time errors
* Interops with JS (you don't have to use elm for everything)

## BUNDLING
Module formats/types in JS:
* IIFE
* Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
* CommonJS(CJS)
* Universal Module Definition (UMD)
* ES6 Modules 

#### BUNDLERS
Browserify - simple, approachable (can be used with Rollup via plugin)
* First bundler to reach mass adoption
* Bundle npm packages for the web (code that uses the CommonJS pattern)
* Large plugin ecosystem

Webpack - Comprehensive
* Bundles more than just JS - import CSS, images, fonts, etc like JS
* Built in hot-reloading web server
* Bundle splitting

Rollup
* Tree shaking (dead code elimination)
* Faster loading production code
* Quite new
* Great for library authors
* No hot reloading and code splitting yet

JSPM - Runtime loader, package manager
* Uses SystemJS, a universal module loader
* Can load modules at runtime
* Has its own package manager
* Can install from npm git
* Uses Rollup in its builder

#### SOURCEMAPS
* Important tool to use when bundling
* Maps code back to original source (bundled, transpiled, minified code)
* Part of the build
* Only downloaded if you open developer tools (only d/ls when you need it)
* There are several sourcemap configurations - chose one that works best for you / the application
