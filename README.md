# Javascript starter kit V1.0

## EDITOR AND EDITORCONFIG RULES
Everyone on team uses same critical editor settings (space vs tabs, line endings etc.)
Strong support for javascript features: 
* Autocompletion
* Parse ES6 imports
* Report unused imports
* Automated refactoring
* Framework Intelligence
* Built-in terminal

## EDITORCONFIG FILE 
Create .editorconfig file in the root of the project. You can specify settings for code here. Some editors have
the functionality built in to read file, some need a plugin (check editorconfig.org for details).

## PACKAGE SECURITY
Options for security check:
#### retire.js
* I've not used this yet, more to come.
#### nodesecuirty.io 
* To install globally: `npm install -g nsp` Then run NSP `nsp check` to scan pacakges. Does not need to be
installed globally. 

Best times to run security checks on packages:
* Manually - Easy to forget.
* npm install - Issues may arise from packages at a later date (after it was installed).
* production build - Expensive to change.
* pull request - Expensive to change.
* npm start - Slows start slightly. 

## WEBSERVERS
* #### http-server
..* (not for use in production, only for development)
* #### live-server

* #### express / koa / hapi
